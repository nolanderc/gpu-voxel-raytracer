Ray Tracing is all the rage in graphics development nowadays. With the rise of
graphics cards with native hardware support for ray tracing it has finally
entered mainstream games. In this series of blogs I will explore the
possibilities of ray tracing on the GPU. Specifically, I will be developing
something very similar to ray tracing, but with minor differences, called
*path tracing*.


# What is Path Tracing?

Pathtracing is the process of simulating rays of light exiting a camera into a
scene, which then bounce around, gather light information, and produces pretty
pictures like the one below.

Path tracing's main difference to ray tracing is that in ray tracing, is that in
path tracing, rays bounce around randomly after hitting a surface. Unlike ray
tracing, where rays follow a fixed trajectroy in a predetermined direction
(could be out of the camera in a specific direction, or towards a light source
after a surface has been hit). 

This makes path tracing more akin to real-life, where light bounces in almost
every direction, which also results in it producing more realistic images, such
as this one:

# The Problem with Path Tracing

Although, there's one downside: noise. Since the rays bounce randomly, we have
no guarantee that rays actually hit any of the light source in the scene: some
might, but some might not. Because of this, some pixel might be very bright, and
other very dark, resulting in a noisy image.

The simplest way to reduce noise in an image is to trace multiple rays. This
increases the likelyhood that a given ray hits a lightsource, if there is one.
The final color of a pixel can then be given by the average of all rays' light. 
Each one of these rays is commonly called a *sample*, and the process of tracing
all the rays *sampling*.

Therefore, in order to get a nice picture in the end, we need as many samples as
possible. However, as this process is quite computationally expensive, it is
very time-consuming and thus hard to do in real-time.


# Path Tracing in Real-Time

One solution to this problem is simply to make the process of tracing one ray in
the scene as inexpensive and fast as possible. The former can be done by
utilizing clever data structures in order to reduce the number of objects in the
scene that need to be checked for intersections with a ray. The latter can be
done by exploiting that path tracing is embarrasingly parellelizable (all rays
are independent of each other), and therefore can easily be offloaded to the
GPU.

In the next post we will look at how a certain data structure called an *octree*
will help us speed lower the cost of each ray. And in the posts after that, we
will begin implementing the path-tracer on the GPU.
